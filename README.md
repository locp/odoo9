* https://github.com/locp/puppet-odoo

## Setup

### What odoo9 affects

* Installs the `odoo` package from the Odoo repository.
* Configures `/etc/odoo/openerp-server.conf`.
* Manipulates the running state of the `odoo` service.
* Optionally configures repositories to enable package installations from
  the Odoo nightly builds.
* Optionally installs the `wkhtmltopdf` package from the Odoo repository.

### Beginning with odoo9

```puppet
include ::odoo9
```

## Usage

The following example will install a basic PostgreSQL database on the
node (using
`[puppetlabs-postgresql](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/postgresql)`)
it then configures the the Odoo repositories.  It then installs the
`odoo` and `wkhtmltopdf` packages with some settings for the Odoo
server:

```puppet
class { 'postgresql::server':
  before => Class['odoo9']
}

class { '::odoo9::repo':
  before => Class['odoo9']
}

class { '::odoo9':
  install_wkhtmltopdf => true,
  settings            => {
    'options' => {
      'admin_passwd' => 'XXX_TOP_SECRET_XXX',
      'db_host'      => 'False',
      'db_port'      => 'False',
      'db_user'      => 'odoo',
      'db_password'  => 'False',
      'addons_path'  => '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/openerp/addons',
    }
  },
  version             => '9.0c.20161009',
